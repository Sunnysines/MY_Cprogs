BEFORE YOU StART my C program there some settings that i have to configure.
i have written it step by step.... so that i find it easy to do it one by one..
HAPPY CODING ;)

1. install gcc and wingc for windows... 
2. for linux it would be present as default compiler as i dont have to worry about the path 
as you will find it alredy configured in linux ..... but for windows i have to configure it manaually
configure it.(from step 3. onwards my steps will be based on linux os system..)
3. install vscode and then the following extentions for C/C++ and code runner.
4. check the intregated terminal settings as well... in the code runner settings
5. write a c programe then go to the run and debug section in vs code and there click on run and debug
then you will find two files created in your workspace folder that is launch.json and tasks.json....
6. then in launch.json click on add configuration were i have choose "(gdb) Launch" option and replace 
default "programe" section with task.json s args section of this thing "${fileDirname}/${fileBasenameNoExtension}"
if i cant understand then i can refer to this video :"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pjBseGfEPU&list=PLxF994db46ADCj8yGxeD5x5Np8Z5sryJq&index=6"
After watching every thing will be clear.....
>>NOTE: in WE HAVE TO FIRST COMPILE AND THEN WE CAN EXECUCUTE THE PROGRAM
7. for external termianl i have to change the "externalConsole:" from false to true
and then compile and run the program....

you can also set up this thing but not compulsory as all the task can be done using code runner
rather this thing will have limitations hence be satisfied with external terminal by code runnner.

ENJOY LIFE ;}
